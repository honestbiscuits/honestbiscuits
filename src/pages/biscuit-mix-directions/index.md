Since there is only a limited amount you can put on a label, we offer more detailed biscuit mix directions. We have a video of the process first and then more detailed written instructions and tips. The process is the same for GLUTEN FREE and regular mixes, though the regular probably required more buttermilk.

###### TIP:
You may want to store the mix in the refrigerator. You do not want for the mix to ever get too warm, or it will not rise properly.

The only additional ingredients you will need are BUTTERMILK. , and a small amount of flour. If you do not have any flour, set aside a few tablespoons of the mix.

##### You will need:
- a clean work surface (counter or table or large cutting board)
- a large bowl
- a large spoon or spatula or spoonula
- a knife or biscuit cutter or round glass
- a baking pan or cookie sheet
- an oven

Get all of your tools ready before you begin.

- Pre-heat the oven to 450 degrees.

Before you open the container, turn it upside-down. This loosens the settled mix. Then turn it back up right side and open it. Pour the contents into a large bowl. (You may use a stand mixer with the general purpose paddle or dough hook attached). Mix up the dry ingredients a bit to counter settling. You will start with 1 and 1/2 cup of buttermilk (but you will probably need a bit more for the regular mix). Pour the buttermilk over the dry ingredients slowly and mix.

###### TIP:
Keep the buttermilk cold until using.

The mix should start to clump up fairly quickly (more quickly with an electric mixer). If it continues to look very dry and not clump up, then go ahead and add a bit more buttermilk. I know this does not seem very exact, but weather and atmospheric conditions affect this and make it imprecise. In a few minutes, a ball of dough should start to form. This takes slightly longer if mixing by hand. If a ball does not form, then you should add more buttermilk. Do so in small amounts, as it is very easy to add too much. The ideal consistency is just a wee bit sticky. You donâ€™t want it too dry or too sticky.

###### TIP:
If you add too much liquid, it will not ruin the biscuits, but the dough will be very sticky and more difficult to work with. If you find your dough is too sticky, you may add a bit more all-purpose flour OR you can make them more like drop biscuits (dropping balls of dough on a pan instead of rolling out the dough.

Keep mixing the ball until all of the dry ingredients are mixed in. Do not keep mixing it after all the ingredients are mixed in or your biscuits may not turn out. Sprinkle some flour on your work surface and dump out the ball of dough onto the surface.

###### TIP:
Try to do all of this as quickly as possible. Also, you want to handle the dough as little as possible. We know that the dough is fun to play with, but the more you play with it and the warmer it gets, the more likely that the biscuits will not rise properly. 

Put a little flour on your hands. You want to turn the dough over on itself, but only 2 or 3 times. No more. No less. Then you may roll the dough out using a floured rolling pin or you can just push the dough out using your fingers. You want the dough to be about one inch tall. Then you cut it with your biscuit cutters or the top of a glass (of whatever size you desire), trying to get as many biscuits as possible out of the flattened dough. Put the cut-out biscuits on the pan. Fold up any leftover dough back into a ball and quickly push or roll back out. Cut some more biscuits and put them on the pan.

###### TIP:
Each time you cut and push the dough, the resulting biscuits are less likely to rise and be fluffy. By the third or fourth time, the biscuits will not rise as high as the first two rounds. The small amount of leftover dough after that can be fun for children (or fun adults) to play with. Maybe just make a snake or other biscuit animal to bake.

Put the biscuits immediately into the pre-heated oven. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes (some ovens may require even a few more minutes). Rotating the pan halfway through is a good idea for even browning, as all ovens tend to have hotter spots. The biscuits should be golden brown when done.

They will cool more quickly if you use a spatula to move them to a cooling rack or plate. When you are ready, you can slather them in butter or your favorite spread. You can also split them and make a delicious sandwich. They are great vehicles for your favorite gravy recipe as well. Just enjoy them.
