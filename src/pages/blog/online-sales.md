We are still testing our online store.  You may see it on the site, but it is probably not yet working.  We are working on this and plan to have an online store for mail order and local delivery by the end of the week.  Soon you will be able to order gift packs of biscuits with jam, as well as just biscuits to keep and enjoy at home for breakfast, dinner, or at a holiday party.  Stay tuned.
