    Head on out to your neighborhood farmers markets while you still can.

As the days grow shorter, head on out to your neighborhood farmers markets while you still can.  Renton is over, but there is one more Madrona Market on Friday.  Columbia City Farmers Market runs until October 17.  Of course, if you are lucky enough to live near West Seattle or Capitol Hill, the West Seattle and Broadway Farmers Markets run year round each Sunday.
