Sorry that this event was canceled, but it was beyond our control (Saturday, September 21, we are going to be participating in a fun event.  **Beast Fest** celebrates the men and women who get their hands dirty working together to raise the cattle, pigs, sheep, chickens and bison on local, sustainable farms and ranches right here in the Pacific Northwest.  There will be plenty of food and music, including Ray Wylie Hubbard and the Picketts.  The fun will take place from 5:00 until 11:00 pm at Pier 66 on the beautiful Seattle waterfront).
