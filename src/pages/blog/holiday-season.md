    Enjoy some delicious fluffy biscuits this holiday.

Biscuits are a great addition to any holiday dinner. This time of year, we are only at two markets, Pike Place Market on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays (9 to 4 - though we often sell out earlier), and West Seattle Farmers Market on Sundays (10 to 2). If you want a dozen or more, we can deliver them to your work or home in Seattle. Just contact us.
