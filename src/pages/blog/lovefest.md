This weekend, we are excited to be participating in [LoveFest](http://www.nwlovefest.org/)!  It takes place in Magnuson Park this Saturday and Sunday (June 30 and July 1).  We will be out there all day each day selling biscuits and enjoying the 45 local and regional music acts, as well as the art and other activities.  Stop by the booth and say "hi" or, heck, even buy a biscuit or two.
