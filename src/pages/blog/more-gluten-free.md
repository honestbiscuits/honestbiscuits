    Additional gluten free menu options added

We are regularly introducing new flavors of gluten-free (and rice-free) biscuits.  We have made MacGregor and Honey biscuits.  We have also made Strawberry and Mom's biscuits (apples and cinnamon).  Next week, we will have Double Berry biscuits (with local organic raspeberries and blackberries).  We cannot keep all of these flavors at every market, but we will have a variety.  Stop by and see what we have.  If you are looking for something particular, you can always email us and we will bring something specific for you to a market.  Or talk to us about having them delivered to you.
