We now have a storefront on Zaarly.com, a website to buy goods and services from local people.  Zaarly has a great promotion going to introduce us to Seattle and get you to sign up for Zaarly and see how easy it is to use. For this promotion, we created this [variety package](https://www.zaarly.com/honestbiscuits/new-customer-special-mixes-4-pack) and put an incredible price on it.  At a **substantial discount**, you get __four different handmade kick-ass biscuits__! However, the promotion (and great price) only lasts until Thursday.  If you order by then, you get a great deal, it helps us out tremendously, and we will **DELIVER** them to you for **FREE** in the Seattle metro area.  [Follow this link](https://www.zaarly.com/honestbiscuits/new-customer-special-mixes-4-pack), you will be taken to the listing.  When you buy it, you can leave a note with your preferences, for instance, if you are vegetarian, you might not want one of our MacGregor biscuits with local bacon.
