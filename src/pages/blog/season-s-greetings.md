Speaking of seasons, we are reaching the end of farmers market season.  Tomorrow, December 23, is the last Broadway Farmers Market until spring.  For the time being, we will only be in the West Seattle Farmers Market after that this winter.  We are looking at some new markets and hoping to return to some of the same markets in 2013.  It is a competitive process, so we shall see.  Stay tuned.

As always, you can also visit one of the coffee shops or stores listed under the tab "Where to Buy Locally" above.
