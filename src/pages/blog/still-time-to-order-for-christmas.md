# Give the Gift of Honest Biscuits

There is still time to order gifts and have them shipped to arrive by Christmas. Order by Wednesday morning (December 22), and we will ship orders right out. Of course, you can always order gifts later for any occasion. We have special Honest Biscuits Gift Boxes and some are new and updated for 2021 and 2022 (like the new Honest Biscuits Fan Box). It is all online, so operators are not standing by, but we will do our best. Look at the Order Now drop down menu and select "mixes and coffee."
