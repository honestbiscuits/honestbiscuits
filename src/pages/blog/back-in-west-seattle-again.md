Yep.  We will be back at the West Seattle Farmers Market this Sunday, (August 12) as a substitute in the middle on the West end of the market.  Now the market has decided to let us stay on through.  So we will be back this Sunday and expect to be there every Sunday until the end of the year  (and we will still be at Broadway too).
