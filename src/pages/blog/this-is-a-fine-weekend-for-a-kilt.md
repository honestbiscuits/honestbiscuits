Sunday March 18 will be the last time that you can get a Kilt Biscuit.  It is filled with Market House corned beef, Mt Townsend Creamery Off Kilter Cheese, Pike Brewing Off Kilter Ale, with organic green onions and a hint of horseradish.

Every other week, they have sold out quickly. We are making more, but you still might want to get to the West Seattle Farmers Market early. As every Sunday, we will be there from 10:00 am until 2:00 pm.
