Have you ever been curious about making your own biscuits? Or have you made biscuits with mixed results? Perhaps you make them all the time, but are looking for tips on making them better? Well you can learn from a pro - the proprietor and main baker for Honest Biscuits. Sidetour has put together some workshops in the Atrium Kitchen at Pike Place Market. [Check them out here](https://www.sidetour.com/experiences/art-stone-biscuit-making-workshop-downtown-seattle) and sign up for one. If these dates and times do not work, we will have more in the future.
