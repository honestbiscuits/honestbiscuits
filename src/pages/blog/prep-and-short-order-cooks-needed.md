Looking for mature, honest, reliable, hard-working people who want to grow with us - cooking eggs, making sandwiches to order, and cooking and prepping ingredients in advance at our store in Pike Place Market. Experience greatly appreciated, but not necessary. We can train great individuals, but you must have a strong desire to do quick and quality work. Honest Biscuits serves honest-to-goodness, kick-ass biscuits. We are committed to making people happy by serving real and delicious food made from locally sourced ingredients. It will be a fun and busy work environment. Full and Part time. Early mornings and weekends required.
