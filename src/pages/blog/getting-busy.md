    Come find us at the Northwest Folklife Festival!

The farmers market season has commenced and we are all over it.  We started at the **Columbia City Market** a few weeks ago and will be there every Wednesday.  This week we start the **Madrona Farmers Market** every Friday afternoon.  In a couple of weeks, we will also start the **Renton** market every Tuesday afternoon.  Yep, it will be a busy summer.

Also coming up, we will be selling some biscuits at the **Northwest Folk Life Festival** on Memorial Day Weekend.  This runs from Friday to Monday, May 24 through 27.  This is an amazing free festival with lots of great music, crafts, and (of course) food.  Stop by and see us.
