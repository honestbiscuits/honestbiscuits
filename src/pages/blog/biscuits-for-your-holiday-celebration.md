Once again we offer free local delivery for a dozen or more regular sized biscuits (or 2 dozen minis).  We have lots of scrumptious flavors, both sweet and savory, to add to your holiday soirees, office parties, or family gatherings.  Just tell us what you need and we will work with you.  If you need them for Christmas, you need to order by Monday morning (December 23).  We will be open between Christmas and New Years for anything else.
