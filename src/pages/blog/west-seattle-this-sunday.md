We will be selling biscuits, including the new Strawberries and Cream, at the West Seattle Farmers Market this Sunday from 10 until 2.  We are substituting for an absent farmer, so we do not know how soon we may be back.  Come see Amanda or Art.  Or you can still visit Greg at the Broadway Farmers Market.
