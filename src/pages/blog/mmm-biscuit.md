We are introducing a new special flavor this Sunday at the Broadway and West Seattle Markets.  The new special has Mexican influences in honor of Cinco de Mayo and spring.  The MMM Biscuit (Matt's Mexican Madness) features some Mexican spiced local organic apples with Mt Townsend Creamery's Campfire Cheese.  This awesome cheese is a smoked jack cheese.  We through in some cilantro and jalapenos to add just a bit of a kick.

The Honey Biscuit proved to be so popular that we have added it to the regular menu.
