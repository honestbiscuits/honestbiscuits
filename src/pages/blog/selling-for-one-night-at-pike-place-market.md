We had such a great time at the Arcade Lights event at Pike Place Market.  We sold a bunch of biscuits to a bunch of happy people, and we raised money for a worthy charity, [the Market Foundation](http://www.pikeplacemarketfoundation.org/about-us/).  We even received numerous votes for best food vendor at the event.

We were excited to be selling our biscuits filled with Beecher's Flagship Cheese, literally right across the street from where the cheese is actually made!  (you can see Beecher's over our shoulder in the photograph)

Thank you to everyone who came out and supported this event.  Hope to see you at Broadway or West Seattle soon.

We did well.

We look good in Pike Place Market.  Hope to be there again sometime.
