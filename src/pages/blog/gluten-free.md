We finally did it!  We came up with a recipe for **Gluten Free Biscuits** that we could be proud to call **Honest Biscuits**.  You will be amazed at the flavor of these scrumptious biscuits. Because we bake them separately, we only sell them frozen in 4-packs, but the biscuits taste amazing when thawed.  We have them each week at the West Seattle Farmers Market, or you can buy them any time from [Goldbelly](https://www.goldbelly.com/honest-biscuits/15133-gluten-free-butterhole-biscuits-giant-8-pack).

We will also be selling them this weekend at the [Best of the Northwest Craft Fair](https://nwartalliance.org/for_patrons/art-of-sponsorship/best-of-the-northwest-art-and-fine-craft-shows/).
