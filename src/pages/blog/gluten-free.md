We finally did it!  We came up with a recipe for **Gluten Free Biscuits** that we could be proud to call **Honest Biscuits**.  You will be amazed at the flavor of these scrumptious biscuits. Because we bake them separately, we only sell them frozen in 4-packs, but the biscuits taste amazing when thawed.  We have them each week at the West Seattle Farmers Market, or you can buy them any time from [Zaarly](https://www.zaarly.com/honestbiscuits).  Zaarly offers free delivery to your home or office on Tuesdays or Fridays.

We will also be selling them this weekend at the [Best of the Northwest Craft Fair](http://www.nwartalliance.com/bestnw/).
