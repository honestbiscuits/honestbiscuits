We have some great _Stuffing Mixes_ this holiday season.  Our classic **Buttermilk Sage** crouton dressing is made with organic sage that we dried ourselves.  The **MacGregor Stuffing** is made from beloved MacGregor biscuits with Bavarian Meats Bacon, Beecher's Cheese, and caramelized organic onions.  We add a bunch of other yummy seasoning.  This year, we are excited to introduce **Gluten-Free Stuffing Mix**.  We did not add to much to this one to accommodate people's food sensitivities, but we can certainly give you pointers on adding more seasoning.

Of course we also have plenty of biscuits for Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, or even this years special **Thanksgivingukkah**.  We have Butterholes, Pike Places (with cheese) and Sweet Potato.  If you order a dozen or more, we will even deliver them to you in Seattle for free!
