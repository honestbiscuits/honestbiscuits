We are excited to be a part of [Urban Craft Uprising](http://urbancraftuprising.com/) next weekend at the Exhibition Hall at Seattle Center.  It is the premier local event for the most amazing craft artists.  Saturday and Sunday, December 1 and 2, we will be there selling biscuits to eat, as well as frozen biscuits to take home from 11:00 am until 5:00 pm.  This is a great place to do some of your holiday shopping while supporting local businesses and craftspeople.  Look for us in the far corner with our friends at [Sweet Coconut Bakery](http://www.sweetcoconutbakery.com/).
