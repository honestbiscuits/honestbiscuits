Things are starting to come together here at Honest Biscuits.

- We have a commercial kitchen, so we can supply you with biscuits for your next gathering or business meeting.  You can email us at honestbiscuits at gmail.
- We will start selling biscuits each Sunday at the Broadway Farmer's Market in Capitol Hill
- Our Chocolate biscuits will feature local and delicious Theo Chocolate.  We are still working on which chocolate works best in the biscuit, but so far all tests have produced good results.  We just want the best.  Theo is the only bean to bar chocolate producer in the United States who produces chocolate from entirely organic and free trade certified cocoa beans.
