_**The Kilt**_:  One of our biscuit's filled with [Market House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CjE4qxukHc) **corned beef** and [Mt Townsend Creamery](http://www.mttownsendcreamery.com/cheese.html) **Off Kilter cheese**.  This aged tommette cheese is washed in [Pike Brewing Company's](http://www.pikebrewing.com/) **Kilt Lifter scotch ale**, so we had to add a bit off that ale to the dough as well.  **Organic green onions** add some flavor and give the biscuit a hint of green.  We add a pinch or two of **horseradish** as well.  Not enough to clear the sinuses, just enough to boost the flavors.

Sure some of the flavors are Scottish, but the overall inspiration is Irish.  I am Scottish-American, but I love celebrating St. Patrick's Day.  Robert Burns Day is just not the same in America.
