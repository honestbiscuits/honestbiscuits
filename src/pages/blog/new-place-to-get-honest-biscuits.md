Honest Biscuits are being sold in a new part of town: the Ravenna and University District area.  [Boulevard Grocery](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Boulevard-Grocery/119025588149208), on Ravenna Boulevard, now carries four kinds of Honest Biscuits, including the new Old School Biscuit with peanut butter and local jam.  The place is a great combination of neighborhood market and coffee shop.  Stop by and tell them we sent you.
