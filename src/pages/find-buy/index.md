We are now at 1901 Western Avenue â€” just south of Victor Steinbrueck Park. You can also reach us by going to the craft day stalls at the northwest corner of the Pike Place Market and across the Joe Desminone Bridge and out onto the new plazas. We are downstairs from that. Or just look for our neon sign on Western Avenue.

#### Mail Order
Our biscuits are sold through [Goldbelly](https://www.goldbelly.com/honest-biscuits), along with some of the best food in America. 

If you are looking for more variety, we have a more extensive store on [Square Marketplace here](https://squareup.com/market/honest-biscuits).

The biscuits are baked fresh to order, so the order will take a couple of days to be processed.  The biscuits are frozen immediately after baking and frozen overnight.  They are shipped frozen (and thaw out in transit) to preserve maximum freshness.  They are great when reheated.

If you are local and cannot make it to one of our markets, just email us and we can figure out a way to get you some biscuits.  We can bake our amazing biscuits for your next office meeting or family gathering.
